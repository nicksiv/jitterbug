## Computer
I use an old Toshiba Satellite L750 and a Dell optiplex 7020 desktop.

I use **Ubuntu** and **Fedora** Linux with the i3wm. I'm a steady user of Linux for the last 10 years.

## Software
- I use *emacs* for everything I can, but I also like and use *vim* for quick edits. From Todo lists to writing prose my workflow tends to pass through text files which I manage easily. 
- For browser I use *Firefox*. I think it's more privacy focused than chrome and I don't like Google's monopoly.
- For file sync I use *Nextcloud* and *Syncthing*.
- For email I use thunderbird and K9 on my mobile. Left gmail for disroot.
- For password management I use *keepassxc*. 
- For music on my computer I use *cmus* and *audacious* for listening to radio stations.
- For office documents I use my distribution's default Libre office. I don't use it heavily, just have some sheets I edit sporadically.

## Mobile phone
I use a typical Samsung android phone.

## Mobile apps
OK, I'm not doing social media and other distracting tasks on my phone, but I rely on it for several things.

1. Google Maps (Trying OsmAnd~)
2. Dialer 
3. Keepssxc
4. NextCloud
5. Viber
6. Firefox
7. Nextcloud Notes
8. VLC
9. NewPipe (instead of Youtube)
10. MuPDF mini (for viewing PDF files)
11. F-Droid for getting as much of my apps I can. 

## My system
My system mainly comprises of a notebook, an online calendar, and some markdown text files forming a small knowledge base.

ðŸ“† Calendar
I use Google calendar. I give them my data, but I find it really convenient. 

ðŸ“‘ Notebook
I currently use cheap spiral notebooks

ðŸ’» Editor
I use vim with vimwiki & pandoc markdown along with a python script to find my notes.
