## Computer
I use an Thinkpad T420 with 8GB of RAM.

I use **Ubuntu Linux 20.04LTS** exclusively on this computer. I'm a steady user of Linux for the last 5 years and for the last year I totally removed Windows from my machine. For desktop manager I was using XFCE4 and openbox for fiddling around, but since my machine supports Gnome now, I'm sticking to it without trying to be original.


## Software
- I use emacs for everything I can. From Todo lists to writing prose my workflow tends to pass through text files which I manage easily. 
- For browser I use Firefox. I think it's more privacy focused than chrome and I don't like Google's monopoly.
- For file sync I use Nextcloud.
- For email I use thunderbird and K9 on my mobile. Left gmail for disroot.
- For password management I use Bitwarden. It's open source and secure. I have different passwords to all my services but in case of bitwarden failure I have no backup solution.
- For music on my computer I use mpg123 for listening to radio stations and Rhythmbox when I have some MP3s to play. I've deleted everything recently! ðŸ˜³
- For office documents I use my distribution's default Libre office. I don't use it heavily, just have some sheets I edit sporadically.


## Mobile phone
I have a junk smart phone, a Huawei P8 lite. It has some problems, but I don't want to spend money on a new smartphone yet since I try not to use it so much. It serves me with the basics, so I'm ok.


## Mobile apps
OK, I'm not doing social media and other distracting tasks on my phone, but I rely on it for several things.

1. Google Maps (Trying OsmAnd~)
2. Dialer 
3. Etar Calendar 
4. Bitwarden
5. News
6. NextCloud
7. Viber
8. Firefox
9. Notes
10. DAVx5
11. VLC
12. Librera Pro
13. GadgetBridge (for my fitband)
14. NewPipe (instead of Youtube)
15. MuPDF mini (for viewing PDF files)
16. F-Droid for getting as much of my apps I can. 

## My system
My system mainly comprises of a notebook, an online calendar, and some text files forming a zettelkasten like knowledge base.

ðŸ“† Calendar
I use Google calendar. I give them my data, but I find it really convenient. 

ðŸ“‘ Notebook
I currently use a moleskine large hard cover Notebook with a dot grid.

ðŸ’» Editor
I use Emacs. I'm trying to leave it but I just can't find something better.
