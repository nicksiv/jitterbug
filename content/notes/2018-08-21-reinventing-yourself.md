I used to love that phrase. But it's totally useless by itself. It is good for catchy post titles on every productivity blog I've read. It's a really empty phrase of the ones I've fed up reading.

Because, if that phrase appeals to you, it means you are wrong at something. You were wrong all along. Otherwise why would you pursue a reinvention?

And it's so hard to admit it.

I was wrong all along.
