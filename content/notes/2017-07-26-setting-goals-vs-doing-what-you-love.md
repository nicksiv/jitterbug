I don't set goals. I never liked them. It is like racing against some unbeatable opponent. They are always subjected to further adjustments and keep reminding you of your own inadequacy.

But I can't just do what I like without schedule either. I'm a byproduct of the Western productivity cult. I have to manage time the best I can. And doing what I like is not an optimal use of time.

Of course you can set goals ON doing what you love. This would be perfect. But then, maybe you won't love it anymore because you already have an optimal schedule of working 9 to 5.

So, there's the dilemma. Setting goals should make you more successful. Unless it doesn't. But you'll never believe that of course. There is always something more. Something better that you can do. Some different productivity evangelist to follow.

A vicious circle.

Maybe the best choice is to start thinking about this problem under a different angle. What is success and why do you think you don't already have it.

Greedy little bastard.
