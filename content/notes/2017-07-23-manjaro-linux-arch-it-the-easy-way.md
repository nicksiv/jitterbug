I'm a Debian user for almost two years. I own an old Toshiba laptop with AMD graphics. This makes things a bit special when it comes to Linux distributions I can use. Debian was one of the few distributions which could successfully hibernate my laptop and it is only one of the reasons why I love it.

Recently, I've decided to test Manjaro Linux on my spare partition. You can imagine my surprise when found out that hibernation worked for my system out of the box. I have set it up choosing the proprietary drivers version and that was all.

Manjaro is based on Arch Linux and includes a great installer (kalamares) and a package manager (pamac). Those useful tools makes the Arch goodness accessible to not-Linux-wizards like me. The XFCE theming is also very aesthetically pleasing and I liked a lot the addition of the drop-down terminal.

After one month of use I had only some random minor glitches which have been fixed after some updates. So far, I could not be happier with it. I think Manjaro Linux is a great solution to setup an Arch based system with minimum effort. If you need the power of Arch and don't have the required time for such a demanding task, it's a perfect solution.
