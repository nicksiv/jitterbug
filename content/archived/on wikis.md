A wiki is a great thing. But not so great when you need to setup one. There are some solutions for Linux. You need to be able to setup a small web server and in many cases a database. If you feel bored and not so geeky you can install a docker image which has everything ready to run but you won't escape the configuration files.

No, I can't do this. Too much overhead. I've made my research and I came back to 
[Tiddlywiki](https://tiddlywiki.com). It's a great piece of software but don't expect its coolness without the nodejs edition. On Linux it's so easy to install node, npm and the tiddlywiki itself that you can get it up and running in less than a minute. And one more plus? All tiddlers become text files. So sweet!ðŸ˜„

I don't know if I will have the strength to make my wiki public someday like those dudes I follow [Phil](https://youneedastereo.com/), [Jack](https://rudimentarylathe.wiki/) and some others, but I will continue updating my second version offline to greatness.
