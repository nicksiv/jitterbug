If you're still struggling with productivity cliches and self declared gurus, take a look at the master list the way [Nicholas Bate](http://nicholasbate.typepad.com/nicholas_bate/) utilizes it.

Forget everything and make a list of all your tasks. No priorities, no tags, no system. Review daily to decide what you want to do today and make another list.

You can keep this list in analog or digital format. You can also use some more aids like the personal compass to help you decide on what to do next. That's all.

That's works well for me. So far.
