The month of April wasn't so rich of movies. That usually happens when I discover a big series. This month's show award, as well as the quarantine's covid19 award goes to the **Community** which gained so many extra fans coming to Netflix (myself included).

1. **Citizen four - 2014 (Laura Poitras)**  
    An impressive record of Snowden's adventure. Better watched while reading his book.  
    
2. **Community S01-06 - 2009 (Dan Harmon)**  
    Great multilayered comedy. Especially the first 3 seasons are just perfect.  
    
3. **The Manchurian candidate - 1962 (John Frankenheimer)**  
    Great story making a good movie to watch even in black and white. Almost half of its budget went to Sinatra.  
    
4. **Persona - 1966 (Ingmar Bergman)**  
    This is not a movie. It is a dream open to interpretations. A really complicated film, a masterpiece for all times.  
    
5. **Bicycle thieves - 1948 (Vittorio de Sica)**  
    A pillar of neo-realism. A real and cruel film staged in a post-war Rome. It can still teach us a lot through the protagonist's eyes.  
    
6. **Eternity and a day - 1998 (Theo Aggelopoulos)**  
    A dreamy and symbolic movie with many of its scenes shot in my hometown. Slow scenes are the director's trademark, some of them are just fantastic.  
    
7. **Unicorn store - 2019 (Brie Larson)**  
    An interesting movie to pass some time.  
    
8. **Breakfast club (rewatch) - 1985 (John Hughes)**  
    The iconic movie that defined a whole generation. It's a bit akward to watch now, but you realize of the issues it brings out. Socked to find out that the movie's song was handed to Simple Minds and it's not their composition.  
    
9. **After life S02 - 2020 (Rick Gervais)**  
    I liked the first season a lot. The second one goes in the same rhythm with the same stratagems. It was a decent watch but I expected more.  
    
10. **The unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt S01 - 2015 (Robert Carlock, Tina Fey)**  
    I didn't think that I would like this series so much. Classic Tina Fey scripts and a really weird group of heroes. It's pleasant even if sometimes it gets a bit over the top with the jokes.
