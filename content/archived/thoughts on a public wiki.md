Today I got the idea to start building a separate wiki. I'm thinking a lot about sharing my content. I am not sure about it but It would be good to start editing my tiddlers to be better and/or public.

The plan would be to continue writing my logs on the new wiki, be all public by default and transfer tiddlers from the old one as needed, reviewing them for public use (or not). Tagged with private would be the tiddlers for not exporting.

I did such things before more than twice and it always ending up importing a large number of tiddlers. Maybe it would be saner now that I use TW5-Bob.

Anyway, after lots of thinking I've decided not to proceed with that yet. Maybe a classic blog would be better in that phase.

This thing is turning into a rabbit-hole (it's emacs all over again)
