A simple story in the post war Italy. A man and a boy roaming the streets of Rome to find the most important thing for their existence. A bicycle. There are no actors, no romance or fantasy. The protagonists moves seem staged and awkward, but their eyes are telling you what you need to know until you break with them. A movie about the cruelty of living which was characterized as one of the pillars of Italian neo-realism. If anyone needs to find things to be grateful for, there are many of those in this movie.
