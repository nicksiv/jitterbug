## About me

Hello, this is **nykosi**. I've been programming since I was a kid. 

I support online freedom, privacy rights and free software. I like sustainable and analog technologies, exploring art via music, films, writing and books.

I'm anti war, wealth, corporations and patriarchy and I mostly write about technology and computers.


### Projects & works
Some music tracks, incomplete drawings, photos and [Jello Dashboard](https://github.com/nicksiv/jello-dashboard)
