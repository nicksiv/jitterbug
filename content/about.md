## About me

{{< figure src="/images/bitmoji.png" class="circle"  height="64">}}

Hello, this is **nyko**. I've been programming since I was a kid. 
Now I'm a recreational programmer and I spend a lot of time tinkering with my computers.

I support online freedom, privacy rights and free software. I like sustainable and analog technologies, exploring art via music, films, writing and books.

I'm anti war, wealth, corporations and patriarchy and I mostly write about technology and computers.


### Projects & works
Some music tracks, incomplete drawings, photos and [Jello Dashboard](https://github.com/nicksiv/jello-dashboard)
