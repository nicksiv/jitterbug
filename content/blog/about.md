Hello ðŸ‘‹, this is nyk0si. Glad to meet you!
                                                                                                        
I've been trying to talk to computers since I was a kid. Mostly failing to do so.
Now after my workday, I'm a recreational programmer and I spend a lot of time tinkering with my computers, mostly learning.
                                                                                                        
I support online freedom, privacy rights and free software. I'm anti war, wealth, corporations and patriarchy.
I like sustainable and analog technologies, classical, jazz and 80s music and arthouse films. 

I mostly read and write about technology and computers. Here's a list of my [favorite blogs](../other/blogroll).

#### Projects & works
* [panoplia](https://panoplia.wordpress.com), an art project of the blogs era, now archived
* [jello dashboard](https://github.com/nicksiv/jello-dashboard), an Outlook GTD homepage
* Some random drawings, music tracks and photos
