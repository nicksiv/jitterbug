My Ubuntu desktop is empty now. I've created a new user, removed excessive applications and logged in.
What did I need all those for? I don't know. I don't have any reasons to write code, nor projects I need to manage. Why did I need all those CLI applications with their configuration files? I can't answer that and I'm not a developer.

I'm making a new beginning. There has to be a reason to keep a tool. All this software (if it's not a game) it's a tool. So you better have a job for each and every one of them.

All is quite now. Got my Firefox with my calendar and Gmail. What else will I need?
