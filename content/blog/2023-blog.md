## back to emacs
>2023-12-08

After fiddling with tiddlywiki and later using markdown format solutions, I've decided to get serious and get back to emacs.
While I was trying all those different approaches, I found out that my needs were minimizing and became far more realistic and down to earth. I now need a simple solution to take some notes. I don't have many projects to track or building a zettelkasten. I really could use anything, but why not chose the tool I love the most?

So, for my new setup I use the following packages and a light theme I've never used before called [leuven](https://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven-theme) (thanks Jeremy Friesen!)

- https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote
- https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper
- https://github.com/Fuco1/dired-hacks
- https://github.com/sabof/org-bullets
- https://github.com/bastibe/org-journal

I loosely manage my notes using denote  without creating many links between my notes (no more zettelkastens for me). If the need arises denote offers a solid linking mechanism so I won't worry too much about that.

I use emacs a full decade now. I have now a working knowledge of the basic keychords and commands, I have my favorite packages and a basic configuration file. Org-mode commands have became a muscle memory, so I don't really need to learn anything new to start working. What makes me sad though, is the fact that I couldn't pass on my knowledge to other people. My blog was built and destroyed so many times, mainly because I was not happy with the content. I found it lame and bad written, so I kept on removing stuff until there is nothing left to be removed.

So I'm starting again, with the hope that I see things more seriously and benefit my readers. Even if there's only one of them.

## so vast, the music
> 2023-02-10

Interesting lists for today that will keep me busy for a long time (and that's if I won't get bored). 

The first one is from the great <https://rateyourmusic.com> site which I'm very fond of. [Best album in every music genre](https://rateyourmusic.com/list/BlindNoldor/rym-charts-best-album-in-every-music-genre/): There are 2.078 genres with the best album for each. So far (I'm on page 4) I can testify that yes, there are that many genres. A bit over analytic to split music in so many sub-genres but a little browsing will prove that the music anyone listens to is such a small fragment of what's really going on out there! 

The second one is a cool database of jazz records [The Jazzomat Research Project](https://jazzomat.hfm-weimar.de/dbformat/dbcontent.html) which contains 456 records including every little piece of info you can imagine including various stats, chords and even music transcription.

Both of those lists really blew my mind and I much respect the people who put work into this! 🙏

## ventoy
>2023-09-10

A multi boot USB is a really useful thing when setting up another linux distro, or need that specific tool to fix partitions, boot records or rescue data. I used to have one but I've erased it over the years. Guess what! I recently needed it so bad, when I had to shrink the only partition on my old laptop to make room for haikuOS.

So, I stumbled upon [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net), which of course is open source and is supported from the most OS types. Its use is really simple. You setup a USB to Ventoy format and just copying all the ISOs you need into its partition.

Booting up the stick, you are presented with a menu to choose which one to boot.

Great tool, I will never erase my USB drive again!
