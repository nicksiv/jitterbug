My new phone's doesn't contain no Google apps or services at all. I've been using a custom ROM for my phone but I could do the same just by disabling all Google services and apps.

My device has better battery life and I'm using only essential apps.
This is a major step towards full degooglification and helps with mindful use of the phone, something I'm trying for some years now.

## Here is the list of basic apps I use

|#|App|Description|
|----|----|----|
|1.|F-droid|The open source store|
|2.|Bitwarden|Password manager from F-droid repo*|
|3.|Nextcloud|Cloud storage|
|4.|K9mail|Mail client|
|5.|DAVx5|Contacts and calendar sync|
|6.|Gadgetbridge|Fitband management|
|7.|Notes|Notes for Nextcloud|
|8.|NewPipe|youTube videos|
|9.|MuPDF viewer|PDF viewer|
|10.|Etar calendar|Calendar app|
|11.|Nextcloud news|RSS reader|
|12.|Fennec Browser|The F-droid Firefox version|
|13.|VLC|Video player|
|14.|Librera PRO|Ebook reader|
|15.|Forecastie|Weather app|
|16.|Viber (Apkmirror)|Proprietary communication app|
|17.|OsmAnd~|Maps & navigation|

For apps that cannot be found on F-droid I use [apkmirror.com](https://www.apkmirror.com/)
Fortunately until now, that goes only for the Viber app which is not open source.
