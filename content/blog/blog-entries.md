## minimizing my blog
>2024-01-06

I'm currently experimenting with a different form of organization for my site. My blog entries are a few so I started a one-file thread for it. I will gradually add older entries I have stored over the years. Let's see how this will go down.

## back to emacs
>2023-12-08

After fiddling with tiddlywiki and later using markdown format solutions, I've decided to get serious and get back to emacs.
While I was trying all those different approaches, I found out that my needs were minimizing and became far more realistic and down to earth. I now need a simple solution to take some notes. I don't have many projects to track or building a zettelkasten. I really could use anything, but why not chose the tool I love the most?

So, for my new setup I use the following packages and a light theme I've never used before called [leuven](https://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven-theme) (thanks Jeremy Friesen!)

- https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote
- https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper
- https://github.com/Fuco1/dired-hacks
- https://github.com/sabof/org-bullets
- https://github.com/bastibe/org-journal

I loosely manage my notes using denote  without creating many links between my notes (no more zettelkastens for me). If the need arises denote offers a solid linking mechanism so I won't worry too much about that.

I use emacs a full decade now. I have now a working knowledge of the basic keychords and commands, I have my favorite packages and a basic configuration file. Org-mode commands have became a muscle memory, so I don't really need to learn anything new to start working. What makes me sad though, is the fact that I couldn't pass on my knowledge to other people. My blog was built and destroyed so many times, mainly because I was not happy with the content. I found it lame and bad written, so I kept on removing stuff until there is nothing left to be removed.

So I'm starting again, with the hope that I see things more seriously and benefit my readers. Even if there's only one of them.

## keeping journals taught me nothing
> 2023-05-25

I stopped keeping a journal a couple of years now. I have just fed up with the whole idea of writing my thoughts - which are basically the same all those years.

I'm a boring person apparently. I'm bored just reading again my entries. And I've wrote a lot. Heavens know I did write and filled several notebooks with my thoughts. Thoughts that on a second reading are just farts in the wind. Just that. Nothing learned, nothing gained. Just reporting, complaining, blah blah and more blah. 

Yet, many successful people stand in favor of journaling. They're telling us the why and how, photos of their filled notebooks, proud for their farts in the wind, probably making some cash out of them. Yes, maybe they have actually something worthy to keep, who knows.

No, I'm done with this selfish model of humans. I choose not to consider myself worthy of thought crystalization for the generations to come.

## so vast, the music
> 2023-02-10

Interesting lists for today that will keep me busy for a long time (and that's if I won't get bored). 

The first one is from the great <https://rateyourmusic.com> site which I'm very fond of. [Best album in every music genre](https://rateyourmusic.com/list/BlindNoldor/rym-charts-best-album-in-every-music-genre/): There are 2.078 genres with the best album for each. So far (I'm on page 4) I can testify that yes, there are that many genres. A bit over analytic to split music in so many sub-genres but a little browsing will prove that the music anyone listens to is such a small fragment of what's really going on out there! 

The second one is a cool database of jazz records [The Jazzomat Research Project](https://jazzomat.hfm-weimar.de/dbformat/dbcontent.html) which contains 456 records including every little piece of info you can imagine including various stats, chords and even music transcription.

## cat trouble
> 2022-09-21

Here's one situation I've never thought about getting into. A cat into my car engine!

As cute as it sounds, it something pretty stresfull for many reasons. The cat maybe is unable to get out. It may be days in there ready to die or most importantly, you can turn on the engine and kill it (along with a big part of your engine!)

All of those thoughts crossed my mind while I was working at the office, having parked my car knowing I had a cat inside. I tried to get it out, stopped the car, poured some water into the engine (I couldn't reached it anyway) and thought it had left. I heard no meaows and I was already late.

In the afternoon I went back to my car and this time looked up more carefully (I had the space and time available), and there it was, little paws under my car in an unreachable place. I called the car help and while I was waiting, I've decided to use the world's collective knowledge. The internet! First in search results, some lady who managed to get a cat out of her engine by playing youtube videos with cat sounds!

Great idea I thought and got right to it. The little cat responded right away to my phone's recorded cat. It came out but afraid of me and jumped right in.

I was relieved that it was not hurt, jumpy and could get in and out whenever it wanted. Then the guy from the car help came and helped me out by pouring some water while I was playing the cat sounds.

Problem solved! Kitty rescued.

## mimetism
> 2022-09-08

Reading [this](https://www.epsilontheory.com/25-anti-mimetic-tactics-for-living-a-counter-cultural-life/), I realized that almost everything I do or like is just mimetic desire.

Now I'm asking myself questions like: why do I like the things I like? Why don't I like the things that noone likes?

Apparently there is always some [model](https://read.lukeburgis.com/p/mimetic-desire-101) that tells us what is good to like.

Oh my, how disappointing is this? ðŸ˜ž We are the sum of out models.

## Quitting Facebook made me happy
> 2017-06-14

I gave a lot thought on the consequences of leaving Facebook. Way more than I should. I have been thinking about it for a couple of years. And then, one day I was on my way to become the weirdo who's not on Facebook. And I did it. I deleted my ten year account and never looked back.

I could write about some things that normally should make me mad, but I was very aware of, like the fact that I had to search through Google to find the permanent removal button for my account. I still don't know how to find it through their menus. Or the awe I felt scanning through the "official" data that Facebook had gathered on me. Of course there is more data, especially from the time I had their sneaky app installed on my phone. The funny thing is that I was aware of this facts and still, it took me some years to make the decision. It was all an addiction.

I smile secretly when I watch people on the streets, waiting in lines, getting their dopamine fix scrolling through their feeds. I can almost feel their anxiety, waiting for the next like, or the super funny meme that will make their day. Facebook is so big in my country that it became a synonym of the internet for the majority of people. You can find many who don't know how to use a search engine or the email. But they use Facebook. It's so annoying. I will not judge them. I just don't want to be a part of this anymore. If it wasn't for Richard Stallman's [article](https://stallman.org/facebook.html), I would still be in the process of thinking about it.

In case you need more data, Salim Virani wrote this excellent [piece](http://www.salimvirani.com/facebook/) which is still relevant today.

## 381 days in Linux
> 2016-09-17

I was waiting to complete a year exclusively in Linux to say that: I did it!
After many years and too many installations I said goodbye to Windows forever.

I can't help but wondering, how did I make it? I didn't learn much more terminal commands from the time of my previous installation and I didn't find the perfect distribution which magically solved all of my problems.

I could say I've had a change of mindset. Something not so simple when you've been using Windows for all of your life. But looking back, that was the only thing I did.

I found out that my failed attempts had to do with a misconception. I was expecting to find applications from the Linux world that would mimic exactly the ones from Windows I was using. Of course that would never happen and I would continue to switch operating systems back and forth, telling myself that Linux wasn't yet mature, and I didn't have time for that.

And then I've had an epiphany: What if I could completely redesign my work-flow and choose my tools again?
That was a bit time consuming, but I'm just a home user, not a business. I made the conscious effort. And eventually it worked. Not because Linux came to me, but because I went to it. I shifted my world for it. Open source software worth it.
