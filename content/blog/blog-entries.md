## minimizing my blog
>2024-01-06

I'm currently experimenting with a different form of organization for my site. My blog entries are a few so I started a one-file thread for it. I will gradually add older entries I have stored over the years. Let's see how this will go down.

## back to emacs
>2023-12-08

After fiddling with tiddlywiki and later using markdown format solutions, I've decided to get serious and get back to emacs.
While I was trying all those different approaches, I found out that my needs were minimizing and became far more realistic and down to earth. I now need a simple solution to take some notes. I don't have many projects to track or building a zettelkasten. I really could use anything, but why not chose the tool I love the most?

So, for my new setup I use the following packages and a light theme I've never used before called [leuven](https://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven-theme) (thanks Jeremy Friesen!)

- https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote
- https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper
- https://github.com/Fuco1/dired-hacks
- https://github.com/sabof/org-bullets
- https://github.com/bastibe/org-journal

I loosely manage my notes using denote  without creating many links between my notes (no more zettelkastens for me). If the need arises denote offers a solid linking mechanism so I won't worry too much about that.

I use emacs a full decade now. I have now a working knowledge of the basic keychords and commands, I have my favorite packages and a basic configuration file. Org-mode commands have became a muscle memory, so I don't really need to learn anything new to start working. What makes me sad though, is the fact that I couldn't pass on my knowledge to other people. My blog was built and destroyed so many times, mainly because I was not happy with the content. I found it lame and bad written, so I kept on removing stuff until there is nothing left to be removed.

So I'm starting again, with the hope that I see things more seriously and benefit my readers. Even if there's only one of them.

## keeping journals taught me nothing
> 2023-05-25

I stopped keeping a journal a couple of years now. I have just fed up with the whole idea of writing my thoughts - which are basically the same all those years.

I'm a boring person apparently. I'm bored just reading again my entries. And I've wrote a lot. Heavens know I did write and filled several notebooks with my thoughts. Thoughts that on a second reading are just farts in the wind. Just that. Nothing learned, nothing gained. Just reporting, complaining, blah blah and more blah. 

Yet, many successful people stand in favor of journaling. They're telling us the why and how, photos of their filled notebooks, proud for their farts in the wind, probably making some cash out of them. Yes, maybe they have actually something worthy to keep, who knows.

No, I'm done with this selfish model of humans. I choose not to consider myself worthy of thought crystalization for the generations to come.

## so vast, the music
> 2023-02-10

Interesting lists for today that will keep me busy for a long time (and that's if I won't get bored). 

The first one is from the great <https://rateyourmusic.com> site which I'm very fond of. [Best album in every music genre](https://rateyourmusic.com/list/BlindNoldor/rym-charts-best-album-in-every-music-genre/): There are 2.078 genres with the best album for each. So far (I'm on page 4) I can testify that yes, there are that many genres. A bit over analytic to split music in so many sub-genres but a little browsing will prove that the music anyone listens to is such a small fragment of what's really going on out there! 

The second one is a cool database of jazz records [The Jazzomat Research Project](https://jazzomat.hfm-weimar.de/dbformat/dbcontent.html) which contains 456 records including every little piece of info you can imagine including various stats, chords and even music transcription.

## cat trouble
> 2022-09-21

Here's one situation I've never thought about getting into. A cat into my car engine!

As cute as it sounds, it something pretty stresfull for many reasons. The cat maybe is unable to get out. It may be days in there ready to die or most importantly, you can turn on the engine and kill it (along with a big part of your engine!)

All of those thoughts crossed my mind while I was working at the office, having parked my car knowing I had a cat inside. I tried to get it out, stopped the car, poured some water into the engine (I couldn't reached it anyway) and thought it had left. I heard no meaows and I was already late.

In the afternoon I went back to my car and this time looked up more carefully (I had the space and time available), and there it was, little paws under my car in an unreachable place. I called the car help and while I was waiting, I've decided to use the world's collective knowledge. The internet! First in search results, some lady who managed to get a cat out of her engine by playing youtube videos with cat sounds!

Great idea I thought and got right to it. The little cat responded right away to my phone's recorded cat. It came out but afraid of me and jumped right in.

I was relieved that it was not hurt, jumpy and could get in and out whenever it wanted. Then the guy from the car help came and helped me out by pouring some water while I was playing the cat sounds.

Problem solved! Kitty rescued.

## mimetism
> 2022-09-08

Reading [this](https://www.epsilontheory.com/25-anti-mimetic-tactics-for-living-a-counter-cultural-life/), I realized that almost everything I do or like is just mimetic desire.

Now I'm asking myself questions like: why do I like the things I like? Why don't I like the things that noone likes?

Apparently there is always some [model](https://read.lukeburgis.com/p/mimetic-desire-101) that tells us what is good to like.

Oh my, how disappointing is this? ðŸ˜ž We are the sum of out models.

## Classical Music
> 2021-06-27

After being obsessed with classical music for more than a year and I hardly listen to anything else, I found a great course to learn more about it.

It was a 9-week course which was interesting, well laid out and useful. Most importantly, one doesnâ€™t have to understand musical notation or have a background in music theory to follow through. And while I had a sense that the classical music world is huge, now I know that itâ€™s massive. It feels like you are connected to a vast, God-sent, thousand-year inspiration ocean.

Itâ€™s so sad I had to grow much older to appreciate it, but I choose to believe that itâ€™s never too late for greatness!

I highly recommend this Yale university free course to classical music fans: [Introduction to classical music](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introclassicalmusic/home/welcome)

## Quarantine diaries
> 2020-11-04

Okay, keeping a blog alive is hard. I never managed to do that more than some months.
But I reboot quite often.

So, it's been almost 6 months. We are now in a 2nd quarantine due to COVID-19 and my blog still exists.
I don't like it very much, It's not what I was going for when I started it (6 times) but I'll keep it anyway.

There are many things that occupied my mind all this time, and I will try to share. Like this big directory of personal blogs. I find some of the blogs inside really  inspiring.

[https://personalsit.es](https://personalsit.es)

Now as a big update from the previous months is that I grow fond of [Tiddlywiki](https://tiddlywiki.com) again. Yes, after many years of using it, I found out that there was a new version which is really awesome. Needless to say I started my own wiki mixing some practices of various knowledge management practices that are trending lately in the field. Then I found a guy (h0p3) with a huge [really inspiring wiki](https://h0p3.neocities.org/) and it made so much sense.

## Trying something new
> 2020-01-30

It's always nice to try something new. I don't usually get such opportunities but you never know when you will get one strange idea to try out.

I had one idea regarding to my music listening habits. I always try to listen to albums. Lots of albums over the years. But there are times when I get tired of my choices. There are certain genres, publications and channels, into and outside the mainstream forming our taste in music. When I was younger I used to believe that my music was my choice. Needless to say, I was so wrong about that.

So what music is next? Something unexpected.

A [random album](https://www.randomlists.com/random-albums?qty=1) that I will turn my attention to.

And who knows? Maybe I stumble to something good which wasn't so "hip" for me back then. This can be a refreshing exercise of modesty and humility.

## I'm off with the infinity loops
> 2019-05-21

Now that I have more free time and I can totally write new posts on this blog I can elaborate on the happy torture of the **infinity loops**.

By infinity loops I'm referring to the endless feeds of information we are facing everyday in our mobile devices.

The time I was spending on my mobile in various apps was way more than I have imagined. And I'm not referring to Facebook (it's been 2 years since I've delete my profile). It was all the rest. Twitter, Reddit, YouTube and recently Netflix. Oh, mobile Netflix. What a way to waste huge amounts of time.

That was until I realized those apps did not offer me any value and I uninstalled all of them. But this isn't so easy as you may think. It is an addiction and like all the other addictions and you are in it **for life**. I didn't make it from the first try. There were times that I was bored or slightly unhappy and cracked. I had quickly installed one of those apps to get a fix.

This is how hooked we all are into this new form of global economy which makes people rich by sucking up our attention. I admit, It took constant struggle but at some point I've made it.

Now the only thing I have in my mobile, is a feed reader and my firefox bookmarks. I've got always something to read but it doesn't lead to a loop. Unfortunately many sites do not offer RSS feeds anymore to make you subscribe into mailing lists and Facebook or Twitter feeds, but oh well!

Who knows what an [RSS feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss) is nowadays anyway?

The upside from all this? From the time I did this choice, I've been reading more physical books, and I have time to get bored, which had led me to some interesting ideas at last. So, I guess this whole deal is something worth struggling for.

## What if photography dies?
> 2018-08-22

I don't remember when I shot the last photo with my phone. I'm sure it's been months.

In the meantime I see everyone else shooting everything. Sunsets, buildings and food. And lots of selfies. Oh God, It seems like yesterday that it was Oxford's [word of the year (2013)](https://www.cnn.com/2013/11/19/living/selfie-word-of-the-year/index.html)! What a revolution.

Now you just shoot and store to the cloud. It's so easy that nobody gets a chance to see a picture let alone print it. I agree with one of my favorite directors that this process is not photography and should get another name. For as long as it lasts.

## Reinventing yourself
> 2018-08-21

I used to love that phrase. But it's totally useless by itself. It is good for catchy post titles on every productivity blog I've read. It's a really empty phrase of the ones I've fed up reading.

Because, if that phrase appeals to you, it means you are wrong at something. You were wrong all along. Otherwise why would you pursue a reinvention?

And it's so hard to admit it.

I was wrong all along.

## Quitting Facebook made me happy
> 2017-06-14

I gave a lot thought on the consequences of leaving Facebook. Way more than I should. I have been thinking about it for a couple of years. And then, one day I was on my way to become the weirdo who's not on Facebook. And I did it. I deleted my ten year account and never looked back.

I could write about some things that normally should make me mad, but I was very aware of, like the fact that I had to search through Google to find the permanent removal button for my account. I still don't know how to find it through their menus. Or the awe I felt scanning through the "official" data that Facebook had gathered on me. Of course there is more data, especially from the time I had their sneaky app installed on my phone. The funny thing is that I was aware of this facts and still, it took me some years to make the decision. It was all an addiction.

I smile secretly when I watch people on the streets, waiting in lines, getting their dopamine fix scrolling through their feeds. I can almost feel their anxiety, waiting for the next like, or the super funny meme that will make their day. Facebook is so big in my country that it became a synonym of the internet for the majority of people. You can find many who don't know how to use a search engine or the email. But they use Facebook. It's so annoying. I will not judge them. I just don't want to be a part of this anymore. If it wasn't for Richard Stallman's [article](https://stallman.org/facebook.html), I would still be in the process of thinking about it.

In case you need more data, Salim Virani wrote this excellent [piece](http://www.salimvirani.com/facebook/) which is still relevant today.

## 381 days in Linux
> 2016-09-17

I was waiting to complete a year exclusively in Linux to say that: I did it!
After many years and too many installations I said goodbye to Windows forever.

I can't help but wondering, how did I make it? I didn't learn much more terminal commands from the time of my previous installation and I didn't find the perfect distribution which magically solved all of my problems.

I could say I've had a change of mindset. Something not so simple when you've been using Windows for all of your life. But looking back, that was the only thing I did.

I found out that my failed attempts had to do with a misconception. I was expecting to find applications from the Linux world that would mimic exactly the ones from Windows I was using. Of course that would never happen and I would continue to switch operating systems back and forth, telling myself that Linux wasn't yet mature, and I didn't have time for that.

And then I've had an epiphany: What if I could completely redesign my work-flow and choose my tools again?
That was a bit time consuming, but I'm just a home user, not a business. I made the conscious effort. And eventually it worked. Not because Linux came to me, but because I went to it. I shifted my world for it. Open source software worth it.
