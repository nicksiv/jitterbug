## Linux CLI

* vim
* tmux
* syncthing
* nextcloud-desktop
* git


## Utilities

* [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net)
	A multi boot USB creation tool, supported by most OS types.

* [MDWiki](https://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/) 
	MDWiki is a very good and fast solution to view a folder of markdown documents in a browser as a web page.
	The only limitation I've found so far is that you can't have wiki links (like Vimwiki) because they won't work.
