## [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net)

A multi boot USB creation tool, supported by most OS types.


## [MDWiki](https://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/) 

A very good and fast solution to view a folder of markdown documents in a browser as a web page. The only limitation I've found so far is that you can't have wiki links (like Vimwiki) because they won't work.
