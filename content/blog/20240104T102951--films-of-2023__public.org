* My Favorite Films watched in 2023
I used to make lots of end of year lists. However, since I don't keep track of many things lately, I mark the passing of 2023 with the top films I've watched in order of greatness.

I could have a favorite albums list as well but no album listening took place. Instead I dove deep into the 80s Underground and that's a whole different thing.
