  <h1 id="the-distro-hoping">The distro hoping</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Debian on and off for some years now. I sometimes test other distributions and sometimes stick to them for a while. I know that most of the non-professional Linux lovers usually do it. It&rsquo;s like you like to spend time on your machine, but since you are not doing it for a living you feel more free to play with all the different options the Linux ecosystem has to offer.</p>
<p>This activity, you can call it a hobby, can be an educational toy for a while. After that, you have gone too far and fall into the trap. You end up tweaking your system without actually doing something useful. I did the same with emacs but that&rsquo;s another story.</p>
<h1 id="focus-by-constraining">Focus by constraining</h1>
<p>Anyway, earlier this year, I&rsquo;ve decided to limit myself in an attempt to make some useful work. So I have switched my 7 years old Toshiba laptop with my kids&rsquo; decade old Toshiba laptop with half the RAM I used to (2MB). The kids were pleased they got to play a way faster and prettier Minecraft and I was happy to have a new challenge!</p>
<p>My (new) older laptop demands 32bit versions of Linux. So I&rsquo;ve had to make a small research and try out some distros just for the fun of it. I knew I would end up with Debian again, but I thought why not giving some other distro a chance?</p>
<p>What I soon found out, was that many distros stopped providing 32bit versions. There were some choices, and I&rsquo;ve started testing them, having only one requirement. Not to spent much time configuring things.</p>
<h1 id="the-32bit-choices-are-limited">The 32bit choices are limited</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried out Fedora. It&rsquo;s one of my favorite ones, but unfortunately I got so many freezes in one day, even in Gnome classic that I had to leave it.</p>
<p>Next I&rsquo;ve tried Linux Mint MATE which I had a smooth experience before with. Disappointed also, from problems of the graphics support for my NVIDIA. I had a screen flickering at the top of the screen. Like I said before, I did not want to deal with such configuration fixes right after installation. So I&rsquo;ve passed once more.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;ve played with freeBSD for a little while. Besides my enthusiasm for the easy installation and the exotic differences, I&rsquo;ve realized that I could not make my NVIDIA work. I knew it would take days researching about it, so I&rsquo;ve took a raincheck, promising myself to give it a try sometime in the future (of course with another laptop).</p>
<p>And before I realize it, a week had passed. I knew I had some more choices, like the Ubuntu family Xubuntu and Lubuntu. The fact was, I couldn&rsquo;t waste more time on this so I got the Debian 10 iso, installed it and voila!
Everything worked great, right out of the box.</p>
<p>I have only the XFCE desktop environment, and everything flies without much customization. I just setup my second keyboard layout, add some shortcut keys and dmenu for running programs in a flash.</p>
<p>You see, in that case I&rsquo;m into the minimal and fast desktop for very valid reasons. You cannot run Gnome 3 on such and old machine, but that&rsquo;s the beauty of Linux. The whole lots of choices.</p>
