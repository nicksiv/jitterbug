  <p>One of the first steps you need to take in order to get free from the Google ecosystem is to get yourself a new email account.<br>
You will think there are lots of options, but it&rsquo;s a tough choice. Most of the free email services belong to the big tech in order to mine your personal data. Good and private email services cost money and they should. There are some free options like basic protonmail which got pretty famous in the last year, but I&rsquo;ve decided I needed IMAP support for my email.</p>
<p>After I&rsquo;ve searched in <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/">privacytools</a> and reviewed several services, <a href="https://disroot.org/">disroot</a> got my attention and I was in luck. They offer a free service which is a very good one for as long as I&rsquo;m using it. Disroot offers also Nextcloud services, in which you can manage your files, calendar and contacts. Although the service is free, you can contribute through donations, because it worth it and you can save yourself some time by degooglifying even faster.</p>
<p>Normally the next step after finding a new mail provider would be to choose a Nextcloud provider. If you don&rsquo;t want to use disroot for these kind of data you can select one of many nextcloud servers offering free space in the <a href="https://nextcloud.com">nextcloud.com</a> website.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I am not affiliated with disroot, I&rsquo;m just happy with their service, but there are some other useful providers into this directory: <a href="https://libreho.st">https://libreho.st</a>.</p>
<p>In fewer words, there are many alternatives to Google and you can stop giving them your data if you are willing to put a little effort into it.</p>
