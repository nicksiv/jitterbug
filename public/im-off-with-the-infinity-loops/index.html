  <p>Now that I have more free time and I can totally write new posts on this blog I can elaborate on the happy torture of the <strong>infinity loops</strong>.</p>
<p>By infinity loops I&rsquo;m referring to the endless feeds of information we are facing everyday in our mobile devices.</p>
<p>The time I was spending on my mobile in various apps was way more than I have imagined. And I&rsquo;m not referring to Facebook (it&rsquo;s been 2 years since I&rsquo;ve delete my profile). It was all the rest. Twitter, Reddit, YouTube and recently Netflix. Oh, mobile Netflix. What a way to waste huge amounts of time.</p>
<p>That was until I realized those apps did not offer me any value and I uninstalled all of them. But this isn&rsquo;t so easy as you may think. It is an addiction and like all the other addictions and you are in it <strong>for life</strong>. I didn&rsquo;t make it from the first try. There were times that I was bored or slightly unhappy and cracked. I had quickly installed one of those apps to get a fix.</p>
<p>This is how hooked we all are into this new form of global economy which makes people rich by sucking up our attention. I admit, It took constant struggle but at some point I&rsquo;ve made it.</p>
<p>Now the only thing I have in my mobile, is a feed reader and my firefox bookmarks. I&rsquo;ve got always something to read but it doesn&rsquo;t lead to a loop. Unfortunately many sites do not offer RSS feeds anymore to make you subscribe into mailing lists and Facebook or Twitter feeds, but oh well!</p>
<p>Who knows what an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss">RSS feed</a> is nowadays anyway?</p>
<p>The upside from all this? From the time I did this choice, I&rsquo;ve been reading more physical books, and I have time to get bored, which had led me to some interesting ideas at last. So, I guess this whole deal is something worth struggling for.</p>
