  <p>I gave a lot thought on the consequences of leaving Facebook. Way more than I should. I have been thinking about it for a couple of years. And then, one day I was on my way to become the weirdo who&rsquo;s not on Facebook. And I did it. I deleted my ten year account and never looked back.</p>
<p>I could write about some things that normally should make me mad, but I was very aware of, like the fact that I had to search through Google to find the permanent removal button for my account. I still don&rsquo;t know how to find it through their menus. Or the awe I felt scanning through the &ldquo;official&rdquo; data that Facebook had gathered on me. Of course there is more data, especially from the time I had their sneaky app installed on my phone. The funny thing is that I was aware of this facts and still, it took me some years to make the decision. It was all an addiction.</p>
<p>I smile secretly when I watch people on the streets, waiting in lines, getting their dopamine fix scrolling through their feeds. I can almost feel their anxiety, waiting for the next like, or the super funny meme that will make their day. Facebook is so big in my country that it became a synonym of the internet for the majority of people. You can find many who don&rsquo;t know how to use a search engine or the email. But they use Facebook. It&rsquo;s so annoying. I will not judge them. I just don&rsquo;t want to be a part of this anymore. If it wasn&rsquo;t for Richard Stallman&rsquo;s <a href="https://stallman.org/facebook.html">article</a>, I would still be in the process of thinking about it.</p>
<p>In case you need more data, Salim Virani wrote this excellent <a href="http://www.salimvirani.com/facebook/">piece</a> which is still relevant today.</p>
