  <p>Okay, keeping a blog alive is hard. I never managed to do that more than some months.
But I reboot quite often.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s been almost 6 months. We are now in a 2nd quarantine due to COVID-19 and my blog still exists.
I don&rsquo;t like it very much, It&rsquo;s not what I was going for when I started it (6 times) but I&rsquo;ll keep it anyway.</p>
<p>There are many things that occupied my mind all this time, and I will try to share. Like this big directory of personal blogs. I find some of the blogs inside really  inspiring.</p>
<p><a href="https://personalsit.es">https://personalsit.es</a></p>
<p>Now as a big update from the previous months is that I grow fond of <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com">Tiddlywiki</a> again. Yes, after many years of using it, I found out that there was a new version which is really awesome. Needless to say I started my own wiki mixing some practices of various knowledge management practices that are trending lately in the field. Then I found a guy (h0p3) with a huge <a href="https://philosopher.life">really inspiring wiki</a> and it made so much sense.</p>
<p>This is a subject I rabbitholed a lot, but more updates on this in later posts.</p>
<p>My most important task (MIT) of today, was writing this post to reboot!</p>
