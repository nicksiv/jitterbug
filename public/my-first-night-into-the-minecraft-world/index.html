  <p>It&rsquo;s been years since I played a computer game. Lost into the responsibilities of parenthood, I forgot the fun of it and how important that can sometimes be. Luckily my kids reminded me of that, because that&rsquo;s one of the wondrous things that kids do. So, while I was constantly bombarded about various Minecraft info from them everyday (things like how to make a cake, a diamond sword and an armor or how it was in the Nether) the thought to play the game started to feel like a good idea and the fact that I had also heard about its impressive effect on the world of gaming, made this idea even more appealing. Starting it out as an activity to perform with the children, I&rsquo;ve made the decision to go with the flow and succumb to the wonderful world of Minecraft. So I gathered some info (there is a ton out there), fired up the game on my laptop and let the magic happen.</p>
<p>Needless to say I was under stress while playing the game, especially on my first night of survival.</p>
<h3 id="basic-knowledge">Basic knowledge</h3>
<p>You begin knowing that each game-day lasts about 10 minutes and make your best to gather some basic resources, build a shelter and some tools before the night comes and all the monsters start creeping around you.</p>
<p>As a beginner, you need to think and act fast. It will help to have prior knowledge of some basic recipes and a plan. That&rsquo;s the reason why there are so many guides. The world of Minecraft is enormous, and seems real even if its randomly generated. Fortunately, the new versions of Minecraft introduced a recipe toolbox so you can learn crafting easily.</p>
<h3 id="todo-list-for-surviving-the-first-night">Todo list for surviving the first night</h3>
<ol>
<li>Find a tree and Gather some wood by hand (around 25 blocks)</li>
<li>Find a hillside and start removing dirt to quickly make a shelter</li>
<li>Make planks out of the wood you have gathered</li>
<li>Create a crafting table</li>
<li>Create a wooden pickaxe</li>
<li>Mine some cobblestone</li>
<li>Build a furnace</li>
<li>Cook some wood to make coal</li>
<li>Create wood sticks and torches (it&rsquo;s better to have light to get through the night)</li>
<li>Close the shelter and spend the night without stress. You can continue safely to mine for more materials (don&rsquo;t forget the torches because monsters keep spawning in dark areas anywhere).</li>
</ol>
<p>The first encounters with the monsters are quite scary, hearing them crawling over your shelter while you are waiting for the Minecraft night to end.</p>
<p>After surviving my first night, Minecraft was the primary subject of conversation between my and my kids. It&rsquo;s been over a year and we still share plans, and I learn new recipes and tips from them. I think they feel good teaching their father!</p>
